**DREAD WITHIN** Survival-Horror Game

*DREAD WITHIN* is a 3D True-First Person survival-horror game developed in Unreal Engine 5 as part of a bachelorâ€™s degree project. The game focuses on immersive atmosphere, psychological tension, and reactive enemy AI. Players explore a dark, procedurally generated forest in search of a lost friend, facing scripted horror sequences and time-sensitive decisions.

## The project integrates multiple technologies:

- **UE5 Blueprints & Behavior Trees** for logic and AI

- **Blender** for custom 3D models

- **Niagara** and **MetaSounds** for effects and audio

- **Enhanced Input System** for gameplay controls

- **PCG & Landmass plugins** for efficient world generation

The experience is designed to build suspense through UI, restricted saves, a stamina system, and environmental storytelling. The final sequence includes a jumpscare and a countdown-based escape. The game was optimized for mid-range devices and includes a modular structure for scalability and maintenance.
